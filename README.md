# Data Science Portfolio by Raymond Nguyen
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and projects that I have made for data analysis and machine learning.

## Classification

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is widely considered to be the "Hello World" project of Data Science and it was my introduction also.  The data and information can be found <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic'>here</a>.  I was able to score within the top 2% with some feature engineering and KNN.

### Predicting Poverty
Analyzed and predicted an anonymized/encoded dataset in order to predict poverty in a given country.  The idea in doing this was to practice basic machine learning fundamentals given zero domain knowledge.  Best performing model used was XGBoost with a log-loss ratio of 0.257.
